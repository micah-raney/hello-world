# hello-world
I honestly would feel much better and more professional talking about myself in the third person, like a novelist.
"Oh, this guy, he does this thing and that. He really knows his stuff."
But that would be so cringy, like upvoting your own comment. 

Anyway, technology is fun.
I started in web-dev, moved on to general programming and graphic design, picked up on server-side, networks, and Linux, and I'm currently on a dual craze of general electronics and hacking them up with Arduino.
